### About 

This is a multi-page website for a fictional architecture firm built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end framework and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling. The purpose of building this application was to create a website with a mobile first approach in mind, and integrating Tailwind CSS. This site is designed by [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/arch-studio-multipage-website-wNIbOFYR6) which provided Figma files for reference and style guidlines.
